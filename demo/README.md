### He wishes for the Cloths of Heaven

by W.B.Yeats

> Had I the heavens’ embroidered cloths,

  > Enwrought with golden and silver light,

  > The blue and the dim and the dark cloths

  > of night and light and the half-light,

  > I would spread the cloths under your feet.

  > But I, being poor, have only my dreams;

  > I have spread my dreams under your feet,

  > Tread softly because you tread on my dreams.
